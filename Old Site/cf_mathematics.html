                <tr>
                  <td width="625" height="500" valign="top"><p align="justify">Mathematics is the study of patterns and structures. Where 
                      natural sciences must eventually refer to phenomena which 
                      are observable and measurable, mathematics is concerned 
                      with structures which are merely possible. Scientists sometimes 
                      find in mathematics a useful language for describing and 
                      analyzing observed patterns; indeed, it is increasingly 
                      difficult to make progress in science without using mathematical 
                      analysis at some stage. Modeling a physical situation mathematically 
                      sometimes makes it possible to predict complex behavior, 
                      and these predictions make it possible to test the strength 
                      of the underlying theory. As a prominent mathematician of 
                      the twentieth century said (somewhat immodestly) &quot;Mathematics 
                      describes the laws that God Himself is obliged to follow.&quot;</p>
                    <p align="justify">The language needed to describe such things can be technically 
                      challenging at times, and the teacher of mathematics must 
                      work to maintain a balance between technical facility and 
                      clarity. On the one hand, one can do little mathematically 
                      if one can not correctly manipulate mathematical expressions 
                      while, on the other hand, the formal manipulation of expressions 
                      can be a rather dry and hollow exercise. Pedagogically, 
                      some students appear to take a great deal of comfort from 
                      the precise and uncompromising rigor of mathematical algorithms 
                      while others rebel at what can at times appear to be an 
                      arbitrary game based on arbitrary rules. But one should 
                      not have to choose. Technical rigor and understanding should 
                      strengthen and reinforce each other. In our classes we will 
                      strive to teach students how to use technical mastery to 
                      gain understanding and how to use intuitive understanding 
                      to sharpen technique.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Students are exposed to problem solving from the earliest 
                      ages. It is at the level of concrete problems that the dual 
                      aspects of mathematical reasoning confront each other. Asking 
                      questions about patterns arising in simple sequences of 
                      numbers or in basic shapes quickly leads to questions and 
                      conjectures that require new techniques. Learning to phrase 
                      these questions in a reasonable way is an essential part 
                      of mathematics. To be technically useful, a mathematical 
                      statement about a problem must use familiar mathematical 
                      objects in a familiar way. To be conceptually useful, a 
                      mathematical statement about a problem must suggest ways 
                      to analyze the situation further.</p>
                    <p align="justify">At all levels, the goal of our classes is fluency 
                      with the basic techniques of mathematics and an understanding 
                      of mathematical reasoning sufficient to approach problem 
                      solving in a variety of contexts. The laws of basic arithmetic 
                      will be presented along with problems of counting and sequence 
                      while more subtle laws of algebra flow naturally from elementary 
                      problems of probability and simple games. The axioms Euclidean 
                      Geometry can be seen in simple drawings and Geometric reasoning 
                      can be learned from constructions with straightedge and compass.</p>
                    <p align="justify">In later years, students are asked to confront problems 
                      drawn from a much wider set of topics. The introduction 
                      of perspective into Renaissance painting brought with it 
                      a host of new questions in geometry and algebra. These questions 
                      in turn gave rise to a variety of new techniques. Trigonometry 
                      didn't truly flourish until it was needed by the architects, 
                      navigators, and geographers of the 16th century and Calculus 
                      had to be invented in order to describe Newton's theory 
                      of Motion. In each of the more advanced courses, mathematical 
                      techniques are taught alongside the questions, which 
                      gave rise to them.</p>
