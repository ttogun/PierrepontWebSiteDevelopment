MATHCOUNTS is a national math competition for students in grades 6 through 8 that fosters problem solving skills, creativity and an appreciation for mathematics. This will be Pierrepont's seventh year of participation in MATHCOUNTS. In addition to participating in the competition, which is held in February, students attend weekly practices where they are exposed to a wide range of problems and mathematical techniques. These weekly sessions are not restricted to students who are eligible to compete; all students with an interest in math are encouraged to attend.

Recently our fantastic math club finished second in the Connecticut State Competition and second in the Southwest Regional Chapter Competition. This is the third consecutive year that Pierrepont has finished in the top three teams in the regional competition. We are also delighted to report that one Pierrepont student placed first and another placed fourth individually. In addition, one Pierrepont student placed second in the "Countdown Round." All six of our students placed within the top fifty of approximately one hundred fifty math students from around the region.
