Rodger Stevens

Rodger Stevens is 38 years old, and has worked as an admissions officer at Bob’s Ivy League University since he graduated 16 years ago. He is very familiar with high schools in New England, but has never seen an application from Pierrepont before. When he receives an application from a student at Pierrepont, he is very intrigued by the school and its unusual nature. Rodger would like to use the site in order to learn more about the school in depth so that he can better understand his applicants. He most importantly wants to learn about the unique academic culture at Pierrepont.

Trisha Wright

Trisha Wright is a mother who is interested in the Pierrepont School as a place for her 5 year old son. She works part time as a social worker who helps women who have stopped working in order to raise their children acquire jobs. Her husband commutes every day to New York City to work at an investment firm. She just moved to Connecticut, and doesn’t know much about schools in the area. She has been looking at the websites of a variety of local private schools, and is trying to find a school that she thinks will be a good environment for her son to learn and grow in. She would use the site to learn about the culture of the school, as well as get a idea of what her son’s experience at the school would be.
