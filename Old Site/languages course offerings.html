                    </span>In this course, the students will complete their survey of the rules of Greek grammar and syntax as presented by the <em>Athenaze</em> series.&nbsp; While studying these mechanics, the students will translate progressively less adapted excerpts from Herodotus, Thucydides and Aristophanes, thereby building strategies for translating Greek accurately, recognizing different Greek dialects, and for using the dictionary to its best advantage.&nbsp; The students will also gain insight into the cultural, social, and political context of these adapted excerpts.</p>

                    </em></span></strong>We will closely read and discuss the Alkestis, with particular attention to Euripides' poetic craft.  As we work through this mysterious play, we will discuss Euripides' mythological, political, and contemporary themes.  Throughout the year, we will also undertake a systematic review of Attic Greek morphology and syntax.  As time permits, we will read selections from the Attic orators relevant the domestic themes of the Alkestis.</p>
                    <p align="justify"><span class="style9"><strong>Greek Tragedy<br />
                    </strong></span>In this course, the students will begin exploring the world of ancient Greek tragedy by reading two complete and unabridged plays in the original&mdash;Euripides&rsquo; Medea and Sophocles&rsquo; Antigone.  In this exploration, the students will be introduced to the genre of Greek tragedy, how its structure informed its performance and meaning.  We will look at each of these plays in their, political, cultural and literary context.  We also continue our focus on Greek morphology and syntax informs.   We will work to develop increasing accuracy, precision, and speed in the skill of translation. </p>

                    </em></strong></span>We will read the entirety of Aeschylus' trilogy in Greek, with especially close attention to the difficulties and ambiguities of Aeschylus' radical poetic diction and voice.  We will also attend to the contemporary contexts&mdash;artistic, historical, juridical&mdash;of the Attic playwright and his work in mid-fifth century Athens; as well, we will give some attention to the reception of the Oresteia in contemporary criticism and art.</p>

                    </strong></span>In this course, the students will begin reading unadulterated works of Latin literature.&nbsp; The first semester is dedicated to reading selections from the prose writings of Sallust and Cicero that explore the conspiracy of Catiline.&nbsp; The second semester begins with selections from Ovid&rsquo;s <em>Metamorphoses</em> and ends with Book I of the <em>Aeneid</em> of Vergil.&nbsp; The objective of this course is to help students gain fluency in reading unadapted Latin texts.&nbsp; To achieve this goal, students not only will be immersed in Latin readings but will conduct a comprehensive review and reinforcement of the rules of Latin grammar and syntax.</p>
                    <p align="justify"><span class="style2">Ovid</span> <br />
                    In this course, the students will survey the oeuvre of the prolific Roman poet Ovid by translating selections from his Heroides, Amores, Ars Amatoria, and Metamorphoses from the original Latin.  While reading Ovid's poetry, the students will focus on building proficiency both in using the dictionary to its fullest advantage and in translating with accuracy and precision while still obeying the rules of English idiom.  In addition to translating, the students will develop skills in analyzing and interpreting the form, language, style, themes and rhetoric of Ovid's poetry.  The students will also gain insight into Ovid as an innovator, including how he combines different genres into new forms, and how he plays upon the literary tradition that preceded him in novel ways.</p>
                    <p align="justify"><span class="style2">Literature of the Late Roman Republic </span><br />
                    In this course, the students will examine the social and literary culture of Rome in the early-to-mid 50's B.C.E. by reading two important documents of that era in the original Latin:  Cicero's tour-de-force courtroom speech Pro Caelio, delivered in defense of one of Rome's promising young glitterati, Marcus Caelius, and the poetry of Catullus, another young up-and-comer in Rome's literary world.  While reading these works, the students will focus on building proficiency in translating with accuracy and precision while still obeying the rules of English idiom.  The students will also develop skills in analyzing and interpreting the form, language, style, themes and rhetoric unique to these authors as well as gain insight into how the historical and social context of these authors influenced the substance of their works.</p>

                      We will read a variety of non-epic poetry&mdash;Vergil's Eclogues, Horace's Odes, Propertius' Elegies, Ovid's Tristia.  We will give particular attention to the distinctive poetic diction of each poet; as well, we will closely consider how each poet transformed prior Greek poetic traditions in the creation of his unique poetic voice.  Finally, we will consider how each poet responded to the the radically new figure of Augustus.<br />

                    This class completes the Integrated Chinese textbook series, focusing on level 2 part 2.  Complex grammar patterns, nuanced qualifying of statements, detailed descriptions, and colloquialisms characterize the lengthy dialogues and narratives that the students study this year.  The texts focus on China and thematic Chinese cultural and historical topics.  As the students' mastery of fundamental grammar patterns and structures is extremely advanced, a strong emphasis is placed on vocabulary acquisition, writing, and character recall.   </p>
                    <p align="justify"><span class="style2">Chinese VI </span><br />
                    The goal of this class is to further deepen the students&rsquo; mastery of syntax, to broaden their vocabulary, and to refine their oral and written expression. Since the students at this level have a sound knowledge and understanding of the workings of Chinese grammar and an extensive vocabulary, they are able to read advanced texts independently.  The class is almost fully conducted by the students. They read the texts, explain and translate, conduct sessions of question-and-answer, re-enact the situation presented in the texts, make syntactic analysis. Over the course of the year, the students will be introduced to a broad selection of texts from a variety of sources. Some texts will be used in listening-comprehension exercises, other texts as reading material. During the second semester we will begin reading and discussing short literary texts and newspaper articles. </p>

                      <span class="style1">Students come to this course with a sound understanding of the fundamentals of French grammar, good reading ability, and basic speaking and writing skills.  They continue to extend and perfect their knowledge of grammar, and speaking and writing skills, with the ultimate goal of acquiring a high level of fluency in idiomatic French.  Writing assignments include translations of short English passages into French, with particular attention to idiomatic usage and the nuances of the language. In this third year the students are also introduced to major literary works, such as Maupassant&rsquo;s novel Pierre et Jean, Voltaire&rsquo;s Candide, Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s L&rsquo;Ecole des Femmes and Jean-Paul Sartre&rsquo;s Les Jeux sont faits.  We will also read poetry selections from Baudelaire&rsquo;s Les Fleurs du Mal and Victor Hugo&rsquo;s Les Contemplations</span></p>
