We currently have two extracurricular activities: MATHCOUNTS and Chess. Each activity is open to all students of an appropriate age; participation, thus, is based on interest. These activities each meet once a week at the end of the school day for forty-five minutes. These programs came about through interest generated by the students and the presence of faculty members on our staff who have the background to offer genuine and in-depth experiences for those students who wish to participate. 

To learn more about each program, you may explore the links below. Parents of current students may find useful documents on our Documents and Forms page as well.
