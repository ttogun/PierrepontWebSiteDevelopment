                    </span>In this course students will be exposed to selected works of early modern English literature in a variety of genres: prose, verse, and dramatic.  Students will gain a sense not only of generic difference and expectation but also of the themes, concerns, and preoccupations of the era that produced these pieces of literature.  We shall begin with a prose work by Sir Thomas More, his History of King Richard III, which will familiarize students with the cadences of early modern English; likewise, it narrates the House of Tudor&rsquo;s party line about the wickedness and depravity of King Richard III&mdash;a theme to which subsequent Tudor-period writers, most notably Shakespeare, would return.  Following this we shall move on to examples of early modern English drama, probably Christopher Marlowe&rsquo;s Tragical History of Doctor Faustus and Ben Johnson&rsquo;s The Alchemist.  As well, we shall read an example of a highly popular literary form, that of the city comedy, a type of lighthearted play (such as Philip Massenger&rsquo;s City Madam) staged for profit in the first decades of the seventeenth century.  We shall also read samples of the period&rsquo;s highest literary form, Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets, at the end of the year. </p>
                    <p align="justify"><span class="style2">The Art of Non-Fiction<br />
                    </span>This class is devoted to examining the range of possibilities for what is termed &lsquo;non-fiction&rsquo;. The students will read a variety of articles, essays, speeches, and criticism by writers and thinkers like Virginia Woolf, Jack London, Stephen Crane, Michel de Montaigne, Abraham Lincoln, Henry David Thoreau, Joan Didion, Martin Luther King, Tom Wolfe, Roger Angell, E.B. White, and James Baldwin. We will also look at long-form journalism and memoir, reading works like John McPhee&rsquo;s Oranges and Truman Capote&rsquo;s In Cold Blood. The students will even explore the edges of what we might consider non-fiction when reading lyrical essays and poetry collections by writers like Lydia Davis, Gertrude Stein, and Thom Gunn. Throughout the year students will read a handful of short novels so that they can continue to hone their analytical writing skills.</p>
                    <p align="justify"> <strong><span class="style3">Literature of Revenge</span><br />
                      </strong>&ldquo;Revenge is mine,&rdquo; says the god of the Old Testament, but the full range of literature shows us myriad men and women who have their hearts set on vengeance. From Homer to Shakespeare to Hardy, writers have examined the human struggle with the desire for revenge. Probable authors include: Euripides, William Shakespeare, Herman Melville, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Henry James, and Jean Genet.<br />

Probable authors include: Hawthorne, De Tocqueville, Whitman, Dickinson, Wharton, Crane, Cather, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, O&rsquo;Neill, Hughes, Larsen, Williams, Moore, Lowell, Bishop, Baldwin, Capote, O&rsquo;Connor, Faulkner, and others.</p>

                    </strong>The Chaucer course is intended to acquaint students with Geoffrey Chaucer&rsquo;s Canterbury Tales as well as Chaucer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Middle&rdquo; English, the direct forerunner and ancestor of our own language.&nbsp; Extensive, collaborative analysis of primary texts will be the norm; enjoyment and understanding are our twin goals.&nbsp; Accordingly, students and teacher alike will read through the bulk of the Canterbury Tales with attention to poetic form and genre as well as to the contours of Chaucer&rsquo;s English.&nbsp; The course begins with the &ldquo;General Prologue&rdquo; and proceeds from Chaucer&rsquo;s shorter and more accessible tales to his lengthier works.&nbsp;</p>

                    </strong>This course examines the elemental relationship between poetry and prose in English and American literature while focusing on understanding themes of alienation from modern society. Prose selections for this course include: Tess of the D&rsquo;Urbervilles , The Great Gatsby and Frankenstein. Verse texts include: Wordsworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tintern Abbey,&rdquo; Coleridge&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rime of the Ancient Mariner,&rdquo; and Percy Bysshe Shelley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mont Blanc&rdquo;, Books I-III of Paradise Lost, selections of Hardy&rsquo;s later poetry, Eliot&rsquo;s The Waste Land and Four Quartets and Hamlet. Student writing for this course includes analyses of Hardy&rsquo;s characters; expositions of conflict between Nature and the pursuit of scientific knowledge; and philosophical investigations into Eliot&rsquo;s poetry. In addition, students memorize poetry, keep journals on their reading, and write creative sketches and poetry.</p>

                    </strong>When Alexander Pushkin wrote Evgeny Onegin, his novel in verse, he ushered in one of the richest literary traditions of the western world: the Russian novel.&nbsp; This course introduces students to two centuries of Russian literature, giving them a foundation in the many social, political, and cultural ideas that arose during this time.&nbsp; Much of Russian literature captivates readers because of its blend of deep philosophical thinking and an abiding folklore.&nbsp; From Gogol&rsquo;s bizarre Saint Petersburg tales to Dostoevsky&rsquo;s examination of evil to Chekhov&rsquo;s contributions to modern drama, the power of Russian literature is undeniable.&nbsp; Possible authors include: Pushkin, Gogol, Lermentov, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Leskov, Turgenev, Chekhov, Bulgakov, and Solzhenitsyn.</p>
