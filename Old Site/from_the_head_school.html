                  <td width="625" height="500" valign="top"><p align="justify">I was both profoundly sad and deeply honored to assume leadership of Pierrepont after the death of our first Head of School, Barbara O&rsquo;Rourke.&nbsp; Losing both a mentor and friend was difficult for me, indeed, for the entire school; yet, somehow, surviving the loss has shown the resilience and fortitude of our small, vibrant community.<br />
                    <br />
The school whose leadership I inherited is an extraordinary place.&nbsp; Our eighty-five students span kindergarten through high school. Each day they fearlessly study ancient languages and texts; they struggle with mathematical theorems and construct scientific experiments; they learn African dance and perform Shakespeare and Euripides.&nbsp; Our curriculum is rigorous and robust, yet is infused with the joy for learning that forms the very foundation of the school.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I recognize both the opportunity and responsibility that comes with the leadership of this young school.&nbsp; Over the past eleven years, I worked side by side, first with Eleanor Beer, and then in our current location with Barbara, to build an institution and understand the challenges we face as we mature.&nbsp; More than any of the academic institutions I&rsquo;ve encountered over my twenty years in education, Pierrepont is clear on its vision:&nbsp; to provide academically-engaged children with an almost uniquely rich and vibrant academic environment.&nbsp; The foundations of the program are complex:&nbsp; attracting and retaining the highest quality faculty, providing a supportive environment to the students to foster academic risk-taking, developing curricular materials that are thorough yet engaging, managing the day to day vagaries of classroom dynamics, among other things.&nbsp; Going forward, I am confident that we will remain true to this vision as we complete the high school curriculum and our first students enter college.<br />
<br />
Great teachers create a lasting impact. I know this from my own experience as a student. My mentors from college, the poet Rosanna Warren and the late classicist William Arrowsmith, instilled in me a willingness to invest in my work, a love of enduring texts, and the value of a life rich in literature and the arts.&nbsp; Each teacher that we hire has this potential:&nbsp; to be that memorable mentor.&nbsp; Our principal job as an academic institution is to provide an environment where students can internalize a love of learning, work with teachers for whom learning is a lifelong endeavor, identify their true passions and interests at an early age, and be prepared for academic pursuits after Pierrepont.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p align="justify">Four years ago, my  son began his education at Pierrepont, starting in a classroom with other five year olds surrounded by an energetic, dedicated faculty.&nbsp; As a parent, I am grateful for my son to spend his childhood as a part of this community; as an educator, I am honored to lead it. </p>
